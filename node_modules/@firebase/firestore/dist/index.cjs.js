    // comparing the UTF-16 code units (chars). This serendipitously works because of the way UTF-8
    // and UTF-16 happen to represent Unicode code points.
    // After finding the first pair of differing characters, there are two cases:
    // Case 1: Both characters are non-surrogates (code points less than or equal to 0xFFFF) or
    // both are surrogates from a surrogate pair (that collectively represent code points greater
    // than 0xFFFF). In this case their numeric order as UTF-16 code units is the same as the
    // lexicographical order of their corresponding UTF-8 byte sequences. A direct comparison is
    // sufficient.
    // Case 2: One character is a surrogate and the other is not. In this case the surrogate-
    // containing string is always ordered after the non-surrogate. This is because surrogates are
    // used to represent code points greater than 0xFFFF which have 4-byte UTF-8 representations
    // and are lexicographically greater than the 1, 2, or 3-byte representations of code points
    // less than or equal to 0xFFFF.
    // An example of why Case 2 is required is comparing the following two Unicode code points:
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // | Name                  | Code Point | UTF-8 Encoding      | UTF-16 Encoding |
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // | Replacement Character | U+FFFD     | 0xEF 0xBF 0xBD      | 0xFFFD          |
    // | Grinning Face         | U+1F600    | 0xF0 0x9F 0x98 0x80 | 0xD83D 0xDE00   |
    // |-----------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
    // A lexicographical comparison of the UTF-8 encodings of these code points would order
    // "Replacement Character" _before_ "Grinning Face" because 0xEF is less than 0xF0. However, a
    // direct comparison of the UTF-16 code units, as would be done in case 1, would erroneously
    // produce the _opposite_ ordering, because 0xFFFD is _greater than_ 0xD83D. As it turns out,

/**
 * An IndexedDB-backed instance of Persistence. Data is stored persistently
 * across sessions.
 *
 * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence
 * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and
 * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is
 * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke
 * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.
 *
 * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK
 * will designate one client as the "primary client". An effort is made to pick
 * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is
 * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary
 * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to
 * IndexedDb’s "owner" store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to
 * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as
 * primary.
 *
 * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only
 * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of
 * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence
 * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see
 * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from
 * persistence.
 *
 * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary
 * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as
 * the addition of new mutations and query targets.
 *
 * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary
 * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent
 * operations will automatically fail.
 *
 * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the
 * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make
 * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary
 * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload
 * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the
 * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a "zombiedClient" entry in
 * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and
 * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.
 *
 * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no
 * longer optional.

/**
 * The Firestore query engine.
 *
 * Firestore queries can be executed in three modes. The Query Engine determines
 * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines
 * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all
 * implementations.
 *
 * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured
 * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).
 * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously
 * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed
 * via a full collection scan.
 *
 * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine
 * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index
 * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation
 * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all
 * queries that the backend supports.
 *
 * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target
 * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries
 * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query
 * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any
 * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.
 *
 * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce
 * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query
 * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer
 *   matches the query.
 *
 * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below
 *   another document that is in the local cache.
 *
 * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.
